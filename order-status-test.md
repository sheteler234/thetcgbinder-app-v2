## Testing the Orders Side Menu Status Update Functionality

### Features Implemented:

1. **Real-time Status Updates**
   - Click any status button to update order status
   - Visual feedback with loading state
   - Confirmation dialogs for critical actions (cancel/deliver)
   - Success notifications

2. **Status History Tracking**
   - Each status change is logged with timestamp
   - Notes are added for context
   - History is displayed in reverse chronological order

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Current status is highlighted with checkmark
   - Loading spinner during updates
   - Disabled state for current status
   - Color-coded status badges

### Test Steps:

1. **Open Orders Menu:**
   - Click user dropdown in header (make sure you're logged in)
   - Click "Orders" to open the side menu

2. **View Sample Orders:**
   - See 3 sample orders with different statuses
   - Each order shows payment method (PayPal, PayPal Test, Credit Card)

3. **Test Status Updates:**
   - Click any order to open details

   - Click different status buttons
   - Verify:
     - Loading state appears briefly
     - Status updates immediately
     - Success notification shows
     - Status history is updated
     - Current status is highlighted

4. **Test Critical Status Confirmations:**

   - Try changing status to "Delivered" → should show confirmation
   - Other statuses update without confirmation

5. **Add Test Order:**
   - Click "+ Test Order" button
   - New order appears at top of list
   - Can immediately test status updates on new order

### Expected Behavior:

✅ Status updates work instantly with visual feedback

✅ Changes persist after page refresh
✅ Current status is clearly indicated
✅ Loading states provide good UX

### Console Logs to Watch:

- "Orders updated: [array of orders]"
- Notification system logs

All status update functionality should now work perfectly!
